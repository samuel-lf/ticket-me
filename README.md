## Ticket Me

This is a starter template for [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) projects.

## How to use this template with the Ionic CLI:

First you install the pre-requisites:
```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
apt-get install -y nodejs make g++
npm i ionic -g
```

Then, you need to run 
```
npm install
```

After that, to preview in your browser simply run:

```bash
$ ionic serve
```

To preview in the emulator, run:

```bash
$ ionic cordova platform add ios
$ ionic cordova run ios
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac.
